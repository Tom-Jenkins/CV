# Supervising / Mentoring Experience

\begin{itemize}
  \item I mentor several postgraduates and early career researchers across research groups in coding, data analysis and genomics. 
  \item I've taught essential wet-lab skills to postgraduates, including DNA extraction, quality assessment and gel electrophoresis.
  \item I designed and led workshops in R programming and analysis, such as spatial analysis and creating interactive maps.
\end{itemize}

# Media

\begin{itemize}
  \item Live interview on \href{https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-devon-61592108}{\textit{\textcolor{gray}{BBC Radio Wales Drive}}} to discuss published research on coral habitat suitability modelling". 
  \item Recorded interview on \href{https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-cornwall-56586904}{\textit{\textcolor{gray}{BBC Radio Cornwall}}} to discuss published research on coralline red algae population genomics"
\end{itemize}
